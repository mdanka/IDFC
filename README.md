This is the "I Don't Fuckin' Care" Chrome extension, made with the purpose
of making the world a better place. 

I'm sure we all know the feeling when we
just see our friends on Facebook share a whole lot of bullshit, gossiping
about urban legends and fake news - not to mention the meaningless quotes
about life and love. That's when we just **don't fuckin' care**!

With this extension, this era has come to an end!

## So tell me, what's the solution?

Oh, it's _really simple,_ my friend!
Just delete the whole feed! **You** don't need that. **We don't need that!**

## Okay, then why don't we just close Facebook and get rid of these problems?

To be honest, Facebook is a really cool platform. We don't want to reject it fully, just the parts we don't like. So this extension lets you:

- Get notifications, messages, friend requests
- Interact with groups
- See individual posts
- Post and share things
- Follow events
- And stuff...
