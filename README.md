This is the "I don't fuckin' care" Chrome-extension, made with the purpose
to make the world a better place. 

I'm sure we all know the feeling, when we
just see our friends on Facebook sharing a lot of bullshits, gossiping
about urban legends or fake news - not to mention the meaningless quotes
about life and love. That's when we just *don't fuckin' care*!

With this extension, this era came to its end!

## So tell me, what's the solution?

Oh, it's _really simple_ my friend!
Just delete the whole feed! You don't need that. We don't need that!

## Okay, then why don't we just close Facebook and get rid of these problems?

To be honest, Facebook is a really cool stuff. We don't want to reject it fully,
just the parts we don't like. So this extension lets you:

- Get notifications, messages, friend requests
- Interact with groups
- See individual posts
- Post and share things
- Follow events
- And stuff...
